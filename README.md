# recursion
Recursion is a top-down approach to problem-solving, based on the assumption that many problems can be solved through decomposition in simpler, indipendent problems of the same nature.
Every recursive step imply a reduction by:
-a constant value, not necessarily the same for all the sub-problems;
-a constant factor, generally the same for all the sub-problems;
-a variable quantity, generally difficult to estimate.
